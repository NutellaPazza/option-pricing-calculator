MONTE CARLO - COMPLETE FEATURE CHECKLIST
=========================================

✅ READY TO TEST!

## Testing Guide:

### 1. Open App
URL: http://localhost:8501
Server Status: ✅ Running

### 2. Select Monte Carlo Model
- Go to sidebar
- Find "Pricing Model" dropdown
- Select "Monte Carlo"

### 3. Test Tab 1: Pricing & Results
Expected features:
✅ Option price calculated (~0.3 seconds)
✅ Green box: "🎲 Monte Carlo Simulation - Using 100,000 simulations"
✅ Statistical Analysis section with:
  - Standard Error
  - Lower Bound (95%)
  - Upper Bound (95%)
✅ Comparison with Black-Scholes:
  - Both prices shown
  - Difference calculated
  - Success/warning message
✅ Greeks table
✅ Model Information (expandable)
✅ Payoff Diagram

### 4. Test Tab 2: Greeks Analysis
Expected features:
✅ Info: "Greeks analysis for Monte Carlo uses numerical approximation"
✅ Current Greeks Values table
✅ All Greeks vs Spot Price chart
✅ Individual Greek selector
✅ Greek vs Spot chart

### 5. Test Tab 3: Sensitivity Analysis
Expected features:
✅ Info: "Using Monte Carlo simulation (50,000 paths)"
✅ Two charts side by side:
  - Price vs Volatility (left)
  - Price vs Time (right)
✅ Scenario Analysis section:
  - Spot Price Change slider
  - Volatility Change slider
  - Days Passed slider
✅ Scenario Results:
  - Original Price (MC)
  - Scenario Price (MC)
  - Change percentage

### 6. Test Tab 4: Heatmaps
Expected features:
✅ Warning: "Heatmaps use 30,000 simulations (may take 10-30 seconds)"
✅ Four sub-tabs:
  1. 💰 Price Surface
     - Sliders for Min/Max Spot and Volatility
     - Side-by-side Call/Put heatmaps
     - Values in cells
  
  2. 📊 Greeks
     - Greek selector dropdown
     - Sliders for ranges
     - Side-by-side Call/Put heatmaps
  
  3. 🌊 Volatility (3D)
     - 3D surface plot
     - Interactive rotation
  
  4. 💹 P&L Analysis
     - Entry premium inputs
     - Side-by-side Call/Put P&L
     - Green/Red color coding

### 7. Compare with Black-Scholes
- Switch model back to "Black-Scholes"
- Compare results between models
- Verify prices are within ~0.5%

## Quick Test Script:

1. Set parameters:
   - Spot: 100
   - Strike: 100
   - Time: 1 year
   - Rate: 5%
   - Vol: 20%
   - Type: Call

2. Monte Carlo Result should be:
   - Price: ~$10.45
   - 95% CI: [$10.40, $10.51]
   - BS Comparison: ~$10.45 (within 0.1%)

3. Greeks should show:
   - Delta: ~0.64
   - Gamma: ~0.019
   - Theta: ~-4.70
   - Vega: ~38.70
   - Rho: ~53.23

## Performance Expectations:

| Operation | Expected Time | Status |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Initial price | 0.3s | Fast ✅ |
| Confidence interval | 3-5s | Acceptable ✅ |
| Sensitivity charts | 5-10s | Acceptable ✅ |
| One heatmap | 10-30s | Be patient ⏳ |
| All heatmaps | 1-2min | Worth it! 💪 |

## Known Behaviors:

✅ **Expected:**
- Monte Carlo slightly slower than Black-Scholes (by design)
- Small differences between runs (~0.01%)
- Heatmaps take time (many calculations)
- Spinners show "Running simulation..."

❌ **Not Expected (report if occurs):**
- Errors in console
- Infinite loading
- Crashes
- Values way off from Black-Scholes (>5%)

## Troubleshooting:

If issues occur:
1. Check server log: `tail -50 streamlit.log`
2. Verify errors: Check browser console
3. Restart server: `pkill -f streamlit && ./start.sh`
4. Check Python version: Should be 3.9+

## What Works Now:

✅ Tab 1: Pricing & Results
✅ Tab 2: Greeks Analysis
✅ Tab 3: Sensitivity Analysis
✅ Tab 4: Heatmaps
✅ Tab 5: About

## What Doesn't Work Yet:

🚧 Binomial Tree model (coming in Step 2)
🚧 American options (needs Binomial Tree)
🚧 Early exercise analysis (needs Binomial Tree)

---
Ready to test: ✅ YES!
Documentation: ✅ Complete
Next step: Wait for user feedback, then Binomial Tree
